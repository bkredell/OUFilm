# OU Film Style Guide

All papers submitted in OU Film courses should adhere to the guidelines laid out in the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS). The sixteenth edition is available for reference in [Kresge Library](https://libcat.oakland.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1349808), and at over one thousand pages is a comprehensive guide to questions of usage and style in academic writing. For basic reference questions students can consult the CMOS online [Quick Guide](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/toolscitationguide.html). A list of additional resources can be found at the conclusion of this document.
In addition, we have adopted a consistent set of formatting guidelines as explained below.

## Formatting
All papers should adhere to the following formatting guidelines:
1. Papers should be formatted with a 1" margin on all sides.
2. Papers should be set in a double-spaced, 12 point font.
Note that for academic writing (and any writing meant to be read in print), you should use a serif typeface. These include Garamond, Goudy Old Style, Hoefler Text, and Times New Roman, among many others. For more on typographic considerations, see Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html) guide.
3. Exceptions to the double-spaced rule:
Any quotation of five or more lines should be blocked off as its own paragraph ("block quotation"). This paragraph should be indented by an additional 0.5" on either side, and the text should be single- spaced. Block quotations should also be preceded and followed by a single blank space on the page. Any captions should be single-spaced.
All text in notes and in the bibliography should be single-spaced.
4. Page numbers should appear on each page, beginning on the first page, in the header.
5. Title pages are unnecessary – instead, please type your name, the course, and the date the paper was
submitted at the top of the first page of your essay. Underneath that, and centered, you should type the title of
the paper.
6. At the conclusion of your essay, you should type the word count for the essay, centered on the page. Note
that this should only reflect the essay itself – i.e., you should exclude the heading, the notes, etc. from your word count. Most word processors will show you a word count for a selection of text. As a rough rule of thumb, essays that have been written according to the following specifications should average approximately 250-300 words per page.
## Files
Unless otherwise indicated by your professor, papers that are submitted electronically should be saved as either a PDF or in Microsoft Word format (.doc, .docx). All files should be saved with a filename that indicates who the author is and what course the assignment is for: e.g. JaneDoeFLM2150FinalPaper.pdf or John Doe FLM 3200 Paper.docx.
## Citations
The Chicago Manual of Style describes two different styles of citation: "Notes and Bibliography" and "Author/Date." Some professors may indicate a preference for one or the other style; in the absence of an express preference, students may choose to use whichever method works better for them. 

#### Notes and Bibliography
When it comes time to place a citation into your paper, you should insert a superscript numeral into the text, accompanied
by a separate note containing the citation, as so.[^1]

Notes come in one of two flavors: *footnotes* (listed at the bottom, or "foot," of each page) and *endnotes* (listed at the end of the document itself). Unless your professor indicates a preference, you may choose either method. 

#### Author/Date
Notes in the Author/Date style are made "in-line" - that is, the citation is included as a parenthetical within the body of the text itself, typically at the end of the corresponding sentence:
> Laura Mulvey argued that narrative cinema was built around a gendered way of looking, in which female bodies are represented as sexual objects for the viewing pleasure of a male viewer (Mulvey 1975).

At the conclusion of the essay, in a works cited section (see below), you would include the full citation to the in-line reference:
> Mulvey, Laura. 1975. "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema." *Screen* 16 (3): 6-18.

### Inserting References in a Word Processor
The simplest way to insert a reference into your writing is using your word processor's reference system. In Microsoft Word and Google Docs, you will find an option for inserting a footnote under the "Insert" menu in the
toolbar.[^2]

### Notes and Bibliographies
Each time you reference a book/article in the notes, you should add a corresponding entry in your paper's bibliography, which should appear on its own page at the conclusion of your document. Note that bibliographic information is formatted differently depending on whether it is referenced in the notes or in the bibliography. For instance, Jon Lewis' book *The New American Cinema* would be referenced as so in a footnote:

> Jon Lewis, <em>The New American Cinema</em> (Durham: Duke University Press, 1998).

But in the bibliography, the same book would be referenced differently:

>Lewis, Jon. <em>The New American Cinema</em>. Durham: Duke University Press, 1998.

Don't worry if this seems overly complicated; even seasoned writers reference the Chicago Manual of Style often in
order to verify that they are citing their sources properly.

## Additional Resources
Students may find it useful to consult Kate Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, which emphasizes the components of Chicago style that are essential for academic writing. It is presently in its eighth edition, and available at [Kresge Library](https://libcat.oakland.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1666933).

Purdue University's [Online Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/02/) (OWL) offers a variety of useful resources for writers, including a thorough overview of Chicago style referencing.
